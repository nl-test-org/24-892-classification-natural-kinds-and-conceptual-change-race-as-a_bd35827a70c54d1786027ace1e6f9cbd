Seminar Presentation
--------------------

Each student enrolled in the course for credit is required to do a seminar presentation on material assigned for the course or other material approved by the instructor. The presentation should be the basis for discussion during half of the seminar period, i.e., for approximately 80 minutes. Students may read a draft of their term paper, but this is not required. At least 40 minutes should be allowed for discussion.

Term Paper
----------

Each student enrolled in the course for credit is also required to submit a term paper on a topic approved by the instructor. Term papers should be from 6000-7500 words long. Students needing a history distribution credit for the course should devote a substantial portion of their paper discussing a philosophical work published prior to 1900.

Papers are due the last day of exam period. Students intending to take an "completable" incomplete must at least submit full drafts of term papers by that date and a final version of their paper by Registration Day of the following term.
